## Why Should You Track Recurring Expenses?

### 1. Avoid Financial Surprises
Recurring expenses are predictable, but they often feel like surprises if they’re not accounted for. By tracking them, you can plan ahead and prevent budgetary shocks.

### 2. Spot Unused Services
How many subscriptions do you pay for but rarely use? Tracking reveals hidden expenses, allowing you to cut unnecessary costs.

### 3. Gain Financial Clarity
Understanding your fixed monthly commitments gives you a clearer picture of your discretionary spending and savings potential.

### 4. Stay on Top of Bills
Missing a recurring payment can lead to late fees or service disruptions. Tracking ensures timely payments and peace of mind.

## How to Track Recurring Expenses

### 1. List All Recurring Costs
Start by listing all your fixed monthly expenses, such as:
- Rent or mortgage
- Utility bills (electricity, water, internet)
- Subscription services (Netflix, Spotify, gym memberships)
- Insurance premiums
- Loan EMIs

### 2. Categorize and Prioritize
Group expenses into **essential (needs)** and **non-essential (wants)**. This categorization helps identify where you can cut back if needed.

Use tools like [DailyExpenseTracker.in](https://dailyexpensetracker.in) to set reminders for upcoming payments. Automating reminders ensures you never miss a due date.

Revisit your recurring expenses every few months.
- Are there subscriptions you no longer use?
- Is it time to renegotiate your internet plan?
