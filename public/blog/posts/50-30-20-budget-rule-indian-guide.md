# The 50/30/20 Budget Rule: A Modern Guide for Indians in 2024

The 50/30/20 budget rule has gained worldwide recognition, but how does it apply to Indian finances? This guide will help you adapt this powerful budgeting principle to your Indian lifestyle while leveraging modern technology for better results.

## Understanding the 50/30/20 Rule

The basic principle is simple:
- 50% for Needs
- 30% for Wants
- 20% for Savings

But in the Indian context, we need to make some smart adjustments.

## The Indian Adaptation: Why Traditional Rules Need Updates

Indian families often have different financial priorities:
- Joint family expenses
- Festival and wedding savings
- Education investments
- Family business contributions

Let's see how to make this rule work for you.

## Breaking Down Your Income: The Indian Way

### 50% - Needs (Essential Expenses)
In Indian cities, this typically includes:
- Rent/Home EMI (25-30%)
- Groceries (10-12%)
- Utilities (5-7%)
- Transportation (5-6%)
- Insurance (3-4%)

**Using Daily Expense Tracker**: Create custom categories for each essential expense. Our app's analysis features help you stay within these percentages effortlessly.

### 30% - Wants (Lifestyle Choices)
Modern Indian lifestyle expenses:
- Dining out
- Entertainment
